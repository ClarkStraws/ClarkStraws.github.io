Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio site! My real name is Henry Haner but my psuedonyms are ClarkStraws and the Latent Arcanist, so if you came looking for one of those people, congrats! You found me.

I'm trying to get better about having an online presence so I've made this site to start documenting my work more thoroughly.

### running introduction.bat ...
Whether you're coming from one of my social media accounts, Github, or even a job application (hello present/future employer, have I mentioned you look nice today?), I think it's best if I give a quick overview of who I am and what I do.

By day, I'm a data engineer at a large healthcare organization. I enjoy the people I work with and the work I do, but I also absolutely love programming and playing around with technology so I always have something I'm toying with for fun at home. I started a company with a few of my friends so that we could build games and software, and I called it Latent Arcana Games.

LAG isn't really meant to be a grand entrance into the game development world. I've made a few games here and there before. But this will officially be the first time I'm really doing it as part of a group, and leading the team from start to finish.

So far we've made a tabletop game, a soundtrack on Spotify, two websites, some half-finished Figma plugins (still in development), and currently we're working on a Unity game. Overall the idea of joining forces has paid off greatly for all of us. It's helping us sharpen our skills and build our portfolios faster, and it's allowing us all to do what we're passionate about, outside of work.

But for real, I'll probably fill this whole website with pages of me waxing poetic about making games. Aside from that I do some other things you might know me for. I write short stories and poetry, I make extremely infrequent Twitch and podcast appearances, and I happen to have a pretty rare medical condition called hypopituitarism that makes me a superhero (hence my Marvel-esque alliterative name). Is any of that relevant to this portfolio site? Probably not. In fact I'll probably talk mostly about the actual process of game development and software development more than anything else here. Hopefully you're as excited about that as I am.

### generating feed ...

Currently, I'm running things over at Latent Arcana Games, but when I'm not too busy with that I also build things on the side. That's not to mention my actual job (LAG is something I do for fun, not profit, after all). On top of working on my game development portfolio I'm also trying to develop my skills as a web developer and data engineer. 

Full stack? More like Sleestak! Anyone?

### installing dependencies ...
I made this site as a place to hold my portfolio. It was pretty easy too, since I'm just using Github Pages. I decided to actually set up Jekyll (on a Windows machine too, blegh) so that I could work with it. I have to say, I'm pretty happy with it. As someone who has learned a lot of different web frameworks I can say Jekyll is pretty neat. It's certainly got its quirks, but what static site generator doesn't. I feel like I have to learn a new one every few months at this point.

Anyways yeah, I really enjoyed building this so I may do more with Jekyll in the future.
